# Charlie's Proejct

Charlie's Project is a website for a chocolate shop with the same name. It's main function is to let users order and compose chocolate packages online. Although I decided to expand the site with more everyday stuff like the About Section or Blog, I took my skills a step further by building this project compared to Game Space (a project I completed previously) with more advanced react patterns and way more libraries. Hope you'll enjoy my work!

## Technologies I used

#### Framework: React

The site login is based purely on React with JavaScript. Compered to the last project, I've decided to use work with more libraries this time. The main libraries i used are:

- React Router

- React Query

- React Hook Form

- React Spring

- Dayjs

#### Styling: CSS Modules using Sass

## Images and Icon Sources

All of the images i used were take from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)(Free trial) .On the other hand Icon I used were all taken from [SVG Repo](https://www.svgrepo.com/). To cut, model and optimize the Images i used [Resize Img](https://www.iloveimg.com/resize-image) as well as [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/).

## Inspiration

The one and only inspiration I had this time was a Polish Ecological Meat Delivery Company called [MiÄ™sna Paczka](https://miesnapaczka.pl/). Credits to them for building such a great site!

## Back-end

I've decided that the best option to story fictional chocolate products and blog posts was to create my own backend. To accomplish that, I used an open-source backend provider called [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).
